Thanks to [Github Pages] and [Jekyll], we have a new site dedicated to [Faster framework].

This website will be our official communication tool with the community. We will post recent news, releases and FAQs here. The code, download files and binaries will be posted in the [Github website], naturally. Also, documentations will be posted in the [Wiki website].
